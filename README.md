# Coursework for the course "Logistics Analytics"

This repository contains the practical assignments completed during the "Logistics Analytics" course.

The first project was based on a real case from the company PedidosYa. The objective was to develop a proposal to increase the acceptance rate of orders by delivery drivers and estimate the impact on service levels and associated costs. We requested data on orders, drivers, stores, and weather. Using Python, we merged multiple datasets and performed exploratory data analysis to identify the key factors influencing order rejections and driver reassignment. We then built a predictive model to estimate how much the reassignment rate could be reduced.

The second project focused on optimizing operations and costs at a mass-consumption distribution center in Chile. We evaluated different storage technologies and proposed a new warehouse layout to minimize storage and handling costs. Additionally, we suggested reorganizing SKU placement within the warehouse to reduce travel time and improve efficiency.
